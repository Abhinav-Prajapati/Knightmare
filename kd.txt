In UCI (Universal Chess Interface) notation, all moves are represented in long algebraic notation (LAN), which means specifying both the starting and destination squares without additional symbols. Hereâ€™s how different chess moves are written in UCI:
1. Normal Moves

    Pawn Move: e2e4 (Pawn moves from e2 to e4)
    Piece Move: g1f3 (Knight moves from g1 to f3)

2. Captures

    Pawn Capture: e5d6 (Pawn on e5 captures on d6)
    Piece Capture: Nf3e5 (Knight from f3 captures on e5)

3. Castling

    Kingside Castling: e1g1 (White castles kingside)
    Queenside Castling: e1c1 (White castles queenside)
    Kingside Castling (Black): e8g8
    Queenside Castling (Black): e8c8

4. Pawn Promotion

    Pawn promotes to Queen: e7e8q (Pawn moves to e8 and promotes to a queen)
    Other promotions:
        e7e8r (Rook)
        e7e8b (Bishop)
        e7e8n (Knight)

5. En Passant

    Example: e5d6 (If a white pawn on e5 captures a black pawn on d5 en passant)

6. Check and Checkmate

    UCI notation does not use symbols like + for check or # for checkmate.
    The move is simply recorded like any other.
